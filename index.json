[{"content":"Specifications Markdown is an incredible useful, extensible format for writing human readable text content to be rendered to HTML and other formats. Parsed and styled, the output can be used for a variety of puposes from websites to formal documents to slide shows.\nHere are some notes and links for the format and information on useful extensions.\nCommonMark Link\nBefore CommonMark, Markdown did not have a solid specification closely followed by markdown parsers. They followed the description given by John Grubar and the ouput of his perl parser for the first markdown implementation, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t follow them closely. Close enough for most markdown to be parsed by any of them and generate usable products. Not close enough to ensure the products would be the same.\nThen CommonMark came along to fix the issues.\nIf you need to implement a markdown specification or need to use/reference an implementation, CommonMark is a good starting point.\nGithub Flavored Markdown Link\nGithub Flavored Markdown is a superset of CommonMark and is used by Github.com and Github Enterprise.\nSome extensions added with to CommonMark are Tables, Task list items, strikethrough, autolinks, and disallowing raw HTML.\nMarkdown (Daring Fireball) Link\nThis is the original description and perl parser for markdown by John Gruber.\nExtensions Not strictly simply for markdown, the following parsers can be integrated into markdown or markdown html rendered content to either properly format or generate useful content.\nMermaid Link\nA JS application for rendering diagrams. Embedding it into either the markdown to html generator or the website directly makes it an incredibly easy text to graphic generator.\nMathJax Link\nA latex math formatting application. Easily embed into the website to properly render equations\n","permalink":"https://qschwagle.github.io/posts/some-useful-markdown-info/","summary":"Specifications Markdown is an incredible useful, extensible format for writing human readable text content to be rendered to HTML and other formats.
